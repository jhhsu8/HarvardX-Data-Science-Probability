#Introduction to Discrete Probability

#1. Probability of cyan - generalized

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# Assign a variable `p` as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box

p <- cyan/(cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Print the variable `p` to the console
p

#2. Probability of not cyan - generalized

# `p` is defined as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
# Using variable `p`, calculate the probability of choosing any ball that is not cyan from the box
p <- 12/15
p

#3. Sampling without replacement - generalized

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# The variable `p_1` is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)

# Assign a variable `p_2` as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw without replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta + yellow)/(cyan + magenta + yellow - 1)

# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p_1 * p_2

#3. Sampling with replacement - generalized
cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

# The variable 'p_1' is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / (cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Assign a variable 'p_2' as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw with replacement.
p_2 <- (magenta + yellow)/(cyan + magenta + yellow)
# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p_1 * p_2
